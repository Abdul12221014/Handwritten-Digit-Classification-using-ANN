# Handwritten Digit Classification using ANN

This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Classification** system using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model. The system is designed to recognize and classify digits (0-9) from images, based on the popular **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits.

## Project Structure

- `mnist.py`: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, training the model, and testing it.
- `mnist_ann_model.h5`: The trained model saved in HDF5 format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
